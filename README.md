A top-down 2D game made for the course R&D Project at Radboud University, cohort 2018. The game was solely implemented in Android Studio using Java.

Note: Due to some GitHub restrictions, I have only included the main files of the Android Studio project. The folder "main" should be placed in /app/src/.
